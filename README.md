## About

PlayerStats is a Minecraft server plugin that adds a command to view player statistics in top-10 format or individually. Currently tested on all versions between **1.16.5** and **1.21.8** on platforms:

- Bukkit
- Spigot
- Paper
- Purpur

(It's possible PlayerStats works on other platforms too, but these are the ones I have explicitly tested.)

## Database Integration (MongoDB & PostgreSQL)

PlayerStats can optionally sync per-player statistics and precomputed top lists to a database. This enables fast leaderboards across restarts and external analytics.

- Supported providers: `postgres` (default) and `mongo`.
- Database writes are executed asynchronously with backpressure to protect the server thread.
- You can restrict which statistic keys are written via `database.tracked-stats`.
- Providers create helpful indexes automatically on startup for reliable performance.

### Enabling the Database

Configure the `database` section in `src/main/resources/config.yml`:

```yaml
database:
  enabled: true
  type: "postgres" # or "mongo"
  generate-top-on-load: true
  generate-top-periodically: false
  generate-top-interval-minutes: 15
  update-player-on-join: true
  top-list-size: 10
  tracked-stats: [] # empty = track all, or list specific keys (see below)

  # Async + write deduplication
  async-threads: 2
  player-update-min-interval-ms: 10000
  top-upsert-min-interval-ms: 60000

  # Verbose provider logging
  verbose-logging: false

  # Mongo
  mongo:
    uri: "mongodb://localhost:27017"
    database: "playerstats"
    collection-player: "player_stats"
    collection-top: "top_stats"

  # PostgreSQL
  postgres:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    database: "playerstats"
    user: "postgres"
    password: ""
    schema: "public"
    ssl: false
    table-player: "player_stats"
    table-top: "top_stats"

  # Connection pool
  pool:
    max-pool-size: 5
    connection-timeout-ms: 10000
```

### Tracked stats key format

Set `database.tracked-stats` to limit which stats are persisted. If empty or omitted, the plugin will auto-detect and track all stat keys.

- UNTYPED: `UNTYPED:STATISTIC`
- ITEM: `ITEM:STATISTIC:MATERIAL`
- BLOCK: `BLOCK:STATISTIC:MATERIAL`
- ENTITY: `ENTITY:STATISTIC:ENTITY_TYPE`

Examples:

```yaml
database:
  tracked-stats:
    - "UNTYPED:LEAVE_GAME"
    - "ITEM:USE_ITEM:DIAMOND_SWORD"
    - "BLOCK:MINE_BLOCK:STONE"
    - "ENTITY:KILL_ENTITY:ZOMBIE"
```

Invalid or unknown entries are ignored with a warning in the console. Keys are validated and capped to a safe length.

### Indexes created automatically

- MongoDB
  - `player_stats`: unique index on `uuid`
  - `top_stats`: unique index on `statKey`

- PostgreSQL
  - `player_stats`: primary key on `uuid`, index on `updated_at`, and a GIN index on `stats` (`jsonb_path_ops`) for future JSONB queries.
  - `top_stats`: primary key on `stat_key`, index on `updated_at`.

These indexes are created idempotently during provider startup.

### Periodic top generation

If you want the plugin to periodically re-generate and persist all configured top lists to the database, enable the scheduler:

```yaml
database:
  enabled: true
  generate-top-periodically: true
  generate-top-interval-minutes: 15 # run every 15 minutes (min 1)
```

- When `database.generate-top-on-load` is true, a one-time generation runs during plugin startup (if the database is enabled).
- The periodic task runs asynchronously and only when the database remains enabled.
- Top list writes are deduplicated using `database.top-upsert-min-interval-ms` and a content hash to avoid unnecessary writes.

### Connection pooling and performance

- PostgreSQL uses HikariCP. You can tune:
  - `database.pool.max-pool-size`
  - `database.pool.connection-timeout-ms`
  - The plugin sets a small `minimumIdle` and a 5-minute keepalive internally.
  - When `database.verbose-logging` is true, leak detection and validation timeouts are enabled to help diagnose issues.

- Asynchronous writes use a bounded queue. When the queue fills, writes fall back to the calling thread (backpressure) to avoid unbounded memory growth.

### Security recommendations

- Use strong credentials; prefer environment variables or a secrets manager for passwords.
- For remote PostgreSQL connections, enable `ssl: true`.
- For MongoDB over the network, include credentials and enable TLS in your URI (e.g., `mongodb+srv://` or `?tls=true`).

## Features

### Easy to use

- One central command that can:
  - Explain **how to use** the plugin with `/statistic`
    ![Usage](src/main/resources/images/usage.png)
  - Show you the **top 10** on your server for all possible statistics with `/statistic ... top`
    ![Top_10](src/main/resources/images/top_10.png)
  - See those same statistics for any **individual player** with `/statistic ... player`
    ![Individual_Stat](src/main/resources/images/individual_stat.png)
  - Or look up the **combined total** of everyone on your server
    ![New_Numbers](src/main/resources/images/new_numbers.png)
  - Guide you through the available options while you type with an extensive **tab-complete** feature
    ![Tab_Complete](src/main/resources/images/tab_complete.png)
  - See the output in a **readable format** that makes sense in the Minecraft world, with more information in hover-text:
    ![Damage_Format](src/main/resources/images/damage_format.png)
  - **Share statistics** that you look up with the other players in chat:
    ![Shared_Top_10](src/main/resources/images/shared_top_10.png)

### No set-up required

- PlayerStats will work correctly regardless of how long your server has already existed - it doesn't
  have to be present when you start a new world
- Data is retrieved directly from already existing playerfiles, so you don't have to
  set up a database, use scoreboards, or anything of the sort

### PlaceholderAPI support

- Placeholders are added in a separate expansion, which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Artemis-the-gr8/PlayerStatsExpansion), in the PlaceholderAPI [eCloud](https://api.extendedclip.com/expansions/playerstatsexpansion/), or downloaded in-game with `/papi ecloud download PlayerStats`
- For more information about the placeholders, see the expansion's [GitHub page](https://github.com/Artemis-the-gr8/PlayerStatsExpansion).

### Safe

- PlayerStats uses **multi-threading** to ensure server performance does not suffer and
  players cannot crash the server by spamming its commands.
- This also means that calculating statistics will be very **fast**.

### Customizable

- You can customize the following (and more):
  - Choose which **range of units** you want to display your time-, damage- and distance-based statistics in:
    ![Time_Format](src/main/resources/images/time_format.png)
  - **Automatically translate** statistics to the language of the client that views them, or customize the statistic-names through the **language.yml** file
  - Use festive formatting, or enable rainbow mode whenever!
    ![Translated](src/main/resources/images/translated.png)
  - Only show statistics for **whitelisted** players
  - Exclude statistics from **banned** players
  - Exclude statistics from specific players with `/statexclude`
  - Limit who is allowed to **share statistics** in chat and how often players can share
  - Limit statistics based on when a player **last joined**.
    This option can be particularly useful if you have had a lot of players join your server in the past
    whose statistics aren't of particular interest to your current player-base.
    On top of that, limiting the amount of players shown in the top 10 can greatly increase performance speed.
  - The **colors** you want the output to be
  - You can go for default Minecraft chat colors, or use **hex colors**!
  - Whether you want the output to have additional **style**, such as italics

- You can configure the following **permissions**:
  - `playerstats.stat` for using the general command (true for everyone by default)
  - `playerstats.share` for sharing statistics in chat (true for everyone by default)
  - `playerstats.reload` for reloading the config (only for OP players by default)
  - `playerstats.exclude` to exclude players from top- and server-statistics (only for OP players by default)
