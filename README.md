## Author Info
I am a relatively new programmer, and this is one of my first projects. I greatly enjoyed making it, 
and I tried to make it as efficient as I could. If you have any questions, remarks, or suggestions, 
please let me know! You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Artemis-the-gr8) 
or reach me by email: artemis.the.gr8@gmail.com
