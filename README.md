## About

## First Time Use

## Features 
* **Easy to use**
   - One central command that can:
     - Show you the **top 10** on your server for all possible statistics
     - See those same statistics for any **individual player** 
     - Guide you through the available options while you type with an extensive **tab-complete** feature

* **No set-up required**
   - PlayerStats will work correctly regardless of how long your server has already existed - it doesn't 
     have to be present when you start a new world
   - Data is retrieved directly from already existing playerfiles, so you don't have to 
     set up a database, use scoreboards, or anything of the sort


* **Safe**
   - PlayerStats uses **multi-threading** to ensure server performance does not suffer and 
    players cannot crash the server by spamming its commands

* **Customizable**
    - Many options

## Disclaimer
For big servers...
